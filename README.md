Monitor digital activity

## Motivation

I'd like to track my digital activity as I believe it correlated with my mood, energy-levels, and may have interesting seasonal effects. This is a descriptive rather than prescriptive tool.

## Sources

- Code-Folder
- Chrome History (via extension)
- Pinboard
- Shell history
- Steam
- Todoist
- Twitter

## Architecture

A periodic polling-service gathers information from multiple sources & collates it in a SQLite database.
